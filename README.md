This serves as a possible future template for a spoof website that may or may not eventually host real products and on going content updating

  touch carousel ... bunk trouble with scaling resulting in a blank space 
      - requires addtional educaiton
      -will remain as reminder to learn more javascript to fix issue
  company description
       - set nicely seems to scale well
 
 **whole project still needs media break points coded**
  
-shop-
    carousel 1&2
      - works great some odd scaling issues resulting in products not being fully centered and add to cart button being cut off
      - add button should place an alert on screen sayin "out of stock" not sure if it does or doesnt work as current preview plug in seems to have issues with windows           commands. Test more on soft launch after media commands are fixed
    carousel 1
      - no specific issues plan on placing further specific designs 
     carousel 2
     - javas script not working
          - issue discovered: the existence of two script instances do not work well together
                    -issue fix: re ID carousel 2 elements and the like accross code documents so the second javascript iteration will control just carousel 2
     panel
       issue 1: only opens to the left 
        fix: get over having button on the right side of the screen for now
        issue 2: carousel objects appear above panel despite lower z-axis placement
          fix: pending...
      add to cart and cart functionality
        pending further javascript understanding needed
