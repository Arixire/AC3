A fake coffee company based off of an ongoing discussing with friends

This serves as a possible future template for a spoof website that may or may not eventually host real products and on going content updating

-home page-

  touch carousel ... bunk trouble with scaling resulting in a blank space 
    requires addtional educaiton
      -will remain as reminder to learn more javascript to fix issue
  company description
       - set nicely seems to scale well
       

new carousel works better needs response work
  if this was for a real company   I would add links on each image to further information and may make dummy pages for the idea soon
  
  *social media badges a possible addition*
 
-shop-

 carousel 1&2( axed found a better carousel that is currently being used on front page to play around with)
      - works great some odd scaling issues resulting in products not being fully centered and add to cart button being cut off
      - add button should place an alert on screen sayin "out of stock" not sure if it does or doesnt work as current preview plug in seems to have issues with windows           commands. Test more on soft launch after media commands are fixed
  carousel 1
      - no specific issues plan on placing further specific designs 
  carousel 2
     - javas script not working
          - issue discovered: the existence of two script instances do not work well together
                    -issue fix: re ID carousel 2 elements and the like accross code documents so the second javascript iteration will control just carousel 2
     panel: put on hold for the moment may use code from port 1 rather than re hash
       issue 1: only opens to the left 
        fix: get over having button on the right side of the screen for now
        issue 2: carousel objects appear above panel despite lower z-axis placement
          fix: pending...
      add to cart and cart functionality
        pending further javascript understanding needed
       carousels dropped for the moment gonna go with a simpler responsive grid and allow time to work on a panel and hopefully a working shop shell
       current display solution will be used for a new site that is in development for theRogueWriter to be used as her personal writings portfolio

links back to code for viewing
preview of site positions container in top left rather than center as intended... will look at later may go with a second paired down style sheet to better control without so much noise.
